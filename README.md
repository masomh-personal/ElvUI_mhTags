## Description

I have been an ElvUI user for years and love the UI overhaul.Â  However, I always wanted more custom options for [tags] in the game. I created this addon to be as lightweight as possible and add new custom tags to ElvUI (ElvUI must be installed). View images of several examples of the custom tags (31 and counting - categorized in the "Available Tags" section of ElvUI).
